Subject: The history of the Incan civilization

Paragraph: The Incan civilization flourished in ancient Peru between 1400 and 1533 CE, and their empire eventually extended across western South America from Quito in the north to Santiago in the south. It is the largest empire ever seen in the Americas and the largest in the world at that time. Undaunted by the often harsh Andean environment, the Incas conquered people and exploited landscapes in such diverse settings as plains, mountains, deserts, and tropical jungle. Famed for their unique art and architecture, they constructed finely-built and imposing buildings wherever they conquered, and their spectacular adaptation of natural landscapes with terracing, highways, and mountaintop settlements continues to impress modern visitors at such world-famous sites as Machu Picchu. The administrative, political and military center of the empire was in the city of Cusco. The Spanish began the conquest of the Inca Empire in 1532 and its last stronghold was conquered in 1572.

Subject: The Texas Longhorn football should be competitive this season

Paragraph: The Texas Longhorns football team are coming off a 5-7 losing season but should have a much better team this year. Coach Steve Sarkisian has done very well with recruiting talented new players and developing a high powered offense. With the addition of a new lightening fast receiving core and a Heisman candidate in the backfield the Horns offense could be unstoppable. Currently, the primary unknown is their defense. There are a bunch of young unproven players on the defensive line that need to show that they can stand up to the high powered offenses of teams such as Baylor and Oklahoma.  Let's hope that come November the Horns have a legitimate shot at the big 12 title.  With the pending move to the SEC this could be their last year in the Big 12.
